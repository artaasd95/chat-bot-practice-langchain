# Troubleshooting Guide - Error Log Issues Resolution

This document outlines the problems identified in the error log and the solutions implemented.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Chat Service Graph Building Error

**Problem:**
```
chat-service-1   | 2025-07-03 14:13:17,403 - app.chat_main - ERROR - Failed to build graph: object CompiledStateGraph can't be used in 'await' expression
```

**Root Cause:**
The `graph.compile()` method in LangGraph is synchronous, but the code was trying to await it as if it were asynchronous.

**Solution:**
- Removed `await` from all `graph.compile()` calls in `app/graph/builder.py`
- Updated `chat_main.py` to call `build_graph()` without `await`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/graph/builder.py` - Fixed all graph compilation calls
- `app/chat_main.py` - Removed await from build_graph call

### 2. Redis Memory Overcommit Warning

**Problem:**
```
redis-1          | 1:C 03 Jul 2025 14:11:51.443 # WARNING Memory overcommit must be enabled!
```

**Root Cause:**
Redis requires memory overcommit to be enabled for proper operation, especially for background saves and replication. However, this is an informational warning that doesn't prevent Redis from functioning.

**Solution:**
- Created a Redis configuration file with optimized settings for containerized environment
- Note: The sysctl `vm.overcommit_memory=1` cannot be set in Docker containers without privileged mode
- This warning is harmless in containerized environments and can be safely ignored

**Files Modified:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Removed invalid sysctls configuration
- `redis.conf` - New Redis configuration file with containerized optimizations

### 3. Redis Configuration File Warning

**Problem:**
```
redis-1          | 1:C 03 Jul 2025 14:11:51.443 # Warning: no config file specified, using the default config
```

**Root Cause:**
Redis was running with default configuration instead of a custom configuration file.

**Solution:**
- Created `redis.conf` with optimized settings for the application
- Updated docker-compose.yml to mount and use the configuration file

**Configuration includes:**
- Memory management settings
- Persistence configuration
- Security settings
- Performance optimizations
- Keyspace notifications for session management

### 4. Grafana Plugin Registration Errors

**Problem:**
```
grafana-1        | logger=plugins.registration t=2025-07-03T14:13:11.476721069Z level=error msg="Could not register plugin" pluginId=table error="plugin table is already registered"
```

**Root Cause:**
Grafana was attempting to register the same plugin multiple times, likely due to configuration issues.

**Solution:**
This is typically a harmless warning that occurs during Grafana startup when core plugins are already loaded. No action required as it doesn't affect functionality.

### 5. Grafana Provisioning Directory Errors

**Problem:**
```
grafana-1        | logger=provisioning.plugins t=2025-07-03T14:13:12.982885518Z level=error msg="Failed to read plugin provisioning files from directory" path=/etc/grafana/provisioning/plugins error="open /etc/grafana/provisioning/plugins: no such file or directory"
grafana-1        | logger=provisioning.alerting t=2025-07-03T14:13:12.983971514Z level=error msg="can't read alerting provisioning files from directory" path=/etc/grafana/provisioning/alerting error="open /etc/grafana/provisioning/alerting: no such file or directory"
```

**Root Cause:**
Missing provisioning directories and configuration files for Grafana plugins and alerting.

**Solution:**
- Created `grafana/provisioning/plugins/plugins.yml` for plugin configuration
- Created `grafana/provisioning/alerting/alerting.yml` for alerting configuration

**Files Created:**
- `grafana/provisioning/plugins/plugins.yml` - Plugin provisioning configuration
- `grafana/provisioning/alerting/alerting.yml` - Alerting rules and notification policies

## Configuration Files Added

### Redis Configuration (`redis.conf`)
- Memory management with 256MB limit and LRU eviction
- Persistence settings for data durability
- Security and performance optimizations
- Keyspace notifications for session management

### Grafana Provisioning
- **Plugins**: Basic plugin provisioning configuration
- **Alerting**: Default contact points and notification policies

## Verification Steps

1. **Chat Service**: Verify graph builds successfully without errors
2. **Redis**: Check that memory overcommit warning is resolved
3. **Grafana**: Confirm provisioning errors are eliminated

## Monitoring

After applying these fixes:
- Monitor the error logs for any remaining issues
- Check service health endpoints
- Verify Grafana dashboards load correctly
- Ensure Redis operates without warnings

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Production Security**: Update Redis configuration to include authentication
2. **Monitoring**: Set up proper alerting rules in Grafana
3. **Performance**: Monitor Redis memory usage and adjust limits as needed
4. **Logging**: Consider implementing structured logging for better error tracking
